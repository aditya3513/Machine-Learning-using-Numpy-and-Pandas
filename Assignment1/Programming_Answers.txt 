Question 1:
1.2 
(a): Confusion matrix at the end in code execution, along with accuracy and average accuracy.

(b): Confusion matrix at the end in code execution, along with accuracy and average accuracy.

(c): For smaller values, We have more branches as threshold doesnt allows less type of similar class values to form a leaf node.
	 But for larger values, there are cases where we have 25 classes saying yes and making a leaf node by values yes)
	 So over all for larger values of threshold we have lesser computation ,since less splits.

(d): Not Done

Question 6: 
(a): All values dicplayed at the end of code execution.

(b,c [since both are same]): 
=> Yes it affects the results as it changes how many similar values will make a leaf node by class name. For lower values it means more leafs.
(d) not done
